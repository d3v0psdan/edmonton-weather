# Edmonton Weather Application

## A simple, modern functional project to display the current weather in Edmonton, Alberta using Laravel 11.x.

This project was created due to the inconvenience of weather websites I've tried, which do not have a live real-time weather 
display. I recently retired my old Microsoft Surface Pro 4 laptop and didn't want it to goto waste, so instead I fully stripped
the entire device of everything except the google chrome browser, and it's sole purpose was just to show the current time and weather.

 I first used the Environment Canada weather website which I loved but the only downside is it didn't have a live timer and real time
 weather updates, so every few hours I would need to refresh chrome which became inconvenient, so I made this application to use the
 Environment Canada weather API to get the exact same information I wanted but without having to refresh every few hours and I could
 actually show the time! 

You might be asking yourself, why didn't you just a script that would automatically refresh the page for you? 
Well to put it simply, that's just too boring and I wanted to make a modern looking design while looking at 
the weather everyday.
